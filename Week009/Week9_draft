9.1.a
The difference between calling a function by value and by reference.
The function may be passed copy of the arguments or references to the actual
arguments themselves.
While the function is running if it has access to the reference then it can
change it on the fly from inside the function but if the arguemnt is copied then
you need to use the return value to modify the original.

9.1.b

Arrays are sometimes more cumbersome and less efficient than they need to be.
Arrays have a set size.
Arrays hold only one data type.

9.1.c

The string comparison function allows you to compare strings to see if they are
equal to, greater than or less than each other.
The function will return 0 if they are the same.
